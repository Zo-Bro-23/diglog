The diagram generated by the RTL viewer looks similar to the circuit diagrams drawn by hand, except that instead of looping outputs back into inputs, the RTL viewer duplicates gates and has "Q0" and "Q1" values, which are presumably values of "Q" from subsequent states of the latch.

## SR Latch

The SR latch was fairly simple, and I assigned outputs using NAND gates, as constructed in my circuit diagram. The waveform worked as expected, with an "unknown" output value until the output was set or reset.

## D Latch

My D latch was also just inspired from my circuit diagram, and I converted the logic gates into Verilog code. The outputs for this too, were "unknown" until the enable input was turned high.

## D Flip-Flop

I wrote code for the D flip-flop like in the diagrams, by reusing my D latch module twice and wiring them up. Initially I tried to avoid the intermediary variables, but that became confusing, so I decided to use them anyways. I had issues with the RTL viewer, and then I realized it was because I named my module "dff" and so Quartus just ignored it.

## Reflection
Once I constructed the latches and flip-flops using logic gates, it was fairly easy to transfer to Quartus. One point of confusion was on how to represent feeding outputs back into inputs. I quickly realized, however, that I could just reuse outputs as inputs and Quartus would be fine. I had dabbled in this previously when I tried repurposing outputs as wires and feeding them back into inputs. I was wondering what the initial state of the outputs would be since they are not specified, and the waveform shows the crossed out "unknown" pattern, so I am assuming that the actual FPGA will have either a half-lit LED or assume the outputs to be low initially.
